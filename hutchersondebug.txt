Chapter 6 Debugging Exercises - Due Wednesday, February 19

Problem 1
The programmer intends for this pseudocode to display three random numbers in the range of 1 through 7. According to the way we've been generating random numbers in the book; however, there appears to be an error. Assume that the random() function is a built-in library function. Correct the pseudocode so that the program works as it should (This has 1 error and is easy to spot)
//This program displays 3 random numbers in the range from 1 to 7.
    Declare Integer count
    //Display 3 random numbers
    For count = 1 to 3
        Display random(7,1)
    End For

Answer: Display random(1,7)

Problem 2
This problem should return the amount of a discount to a main() module when the calcDiscountPrice() function is called. (This has 1 error and is pretty easy to spot.)
//The calcDiscountPrice funciton accepts an item's price and the discount percentage as arguments. It uses those values to calculate and return the discounted price.
Function Real calcDiscountPrice(Real price, Real percentage)
Function Real calcDiscountPrice(Real price, Real percentage)
    //Declarations
    Declare Real discount
    Declare Real discountPrice

    //Calculations
    discount = price * percentage
    discountPrice = price - discount
    
    //Return the discount amount
    Return discount

Answer: It's because you are returning discount not discountPrice

return discountPrice

Problem 3
This problem should calculate and display 10% of any number given. Correct the pseudocode (a bit harder than the last 2 problems)
Module main()
    //Declarations
    Declare Real value, result
    
    //Get a value from the user
    Display "enter a value"
    Input value
    
    //Set 10% of the value
    result = tenPercent(value)
    
    //Display value
    Display "10 percent of ", value, " is ", result
End Module

//The tenPercent() function calculates and returns 10% of any number passed into it
Function Real tenPercent(Real num)
    //Declarations
    Declare Integer myResult
    
    //Calculations
    myResult = num * .10
    
    //Return the result
    Return myResult

Answer: The Returned value is not stored in the variable result. result = Call tenPercent(value)
    
End Function
