Chapter 5 Debugging Exercises
Problem 1.
The following pseudocode is an infinite loop. Without creating any new variables or changing the existing variable types, correct the pseudocode so that the program does not loop forever and ever...

Declare Boolean finished = False
Declare Real value, cube

While NOT finished
	Display "Enter a value to be cubed"
	Input value
	Set cube = value^3
	Display value, " cubed is ", cube
End While

Problem 2.
This program should display the numbers 1 - 5, and then display the message "Time's up!" It does not display the results correctly. Correct the pseudocode so that the program displays the results correctly.
Declare Integer counter = 1
Const Integer TIME_LIMIT = 5

While counter <= TIME_LIMIT
	Display counter
	Set counter = counter + 1
End While
Display "Time's Up!"

Problem 3.
This program should get as input 5 sets of two numbers each, then calculate the sum of each set, and calculate the sum of all the numbers entered. It will not function as intended, however. Correct the pseudocode so that the program runs as intended. Nested loops are required.
//This program calculates the sum of five sets of two numbers.
Declare Integer number, sum, total
Declare Integer sets, numbers

Constant Integer MAX_SETS = 5
Constant Integer MAX_NUMBERS = 2

Set sum = 0;
Set total = 0;

For sets = 1 To MAX_NUMBERS
	For numbers = 1 to MAX_NUMBERS
		Display "Enter number", numbers, " of set ", sets, "."
		Input number
		Set sum = sum + number
	End For
	Display "The sum of set ", sets, " is ", sum, "."
	Set total = total + sum
	Set sum = 0
End For
Display "The total of all the sets is ", total, "."
